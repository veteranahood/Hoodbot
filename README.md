# HoodBot 🤖📈  
### By Anthony Scott Hood

HoodBot is a multi-agent, AI-assisted crypto trading dashboard built with Python and Kivy, designed to give users **full control** over how their capital is deployed — live or simulated.

This project emphasizes transparency, user choice, and modular agent intelligence.

## 🔥 Core Features

### 🧠 Multi-Agent System
- Independent trading agents with:
  - Live activity feeds
  - Voting-based decision logic
  - Reinforcement Learning (RL) governor
- Agents collaborate or disagree — majority rules unless overridden by risk controls

### 🧭 Dual Trading Modes
- **Simulation Mode**
  - Paper trading
  - Strategy testing
  - Zero risk
- **Live Mode**
  - Real trades using user-provided API keys
  - User explicitly chooses to enable live trading

> HoodBot never trades live funds without user consent.
